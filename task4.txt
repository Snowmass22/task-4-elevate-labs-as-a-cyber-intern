A firewall acts as a gatekeeper between a computer/network and the outside world. It operates by filtering data packets based on a set of predefined rules.

Filtering Mechanism:
Inspection: A data packet arrives at the firewall.

Rule Check: The firewall inspects the packet's headers, looking at key information:

Source IP Address: Where the packet came from.

Destination IP Address: Where the packet is going.

Protocol: (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).

Port Number: The specific application/service (e.g., Port 80 for HTTP, Port 22 for SSH).

Action: The firewall compares the packet information against its ordered list of rules. The first rule that matches determines the action:

ALLOW/ACCEPT: The packet is permitted to pass through.

DENY/BLOCK: The packet is discarded, and no response is sent to the sender.

REJECT: The packet is discarded, and an error message (like ICMP "Destination Unreachable") is sent back to the sender.
